# IFC.js Crash Course Overview

This repository provides an overview of the IFC.js Crash Course, the first course offered by That Open University (formerly IFC.js) around 2022. The course was designed to empower developers to create web-based Building Information Modeling (BIM) applications using the IFC.js library.

## Course Summary

**Objective**: Teach developers to build native IFC-based applications, viewers, and integrations for the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry using JavaScript and WebAssembly (WASM).

**Duration**: Approximately 20 hours across 90 video lessons.

**Content**:

- Fundamentals of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Usage of developer tools and libraries such as Git, Three.js, and IFC.js.
- Techniques for reading, writing, and editing IFC files.
- Advanced topics, including:
  - Integration with Geographic Information Systems (GIS).
  - Generating CAD drawings.
  - Manipulating 3D scans.
  - Connecting to databases.

**Delivery**: Lifetime access to video content with a focus on hands-on learning through practical projects, such as building a 3D IFC viewer using Three.js and IFC.js.

**Target Audience**: Aimed at developers with basic web development knowledge. Welcomed both coders (JavaScript, C++, WebAssembly) and non-coders contributing to the open-source IFC.js ecosystem.

**Impact**: Course funds supported the ongoing development of IFC.js, promoting innovation in web-based BIM technologies and making BIM application development accessible to individuals and smaller companies.

## Why IFC.js?

IFC.js enables developers to transform web browsers into powerful BIM platforms, leveraging open-source tools to democratize access to BIM technology. This course was a foundational step in teaching developers to harness these capabilities.
